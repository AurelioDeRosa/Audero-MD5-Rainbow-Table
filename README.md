# Audero MD5 Rainbow Table #
[Audero MD5 Rainbow Table](https://github.com/AurelioDeRosa/Audero-MD5-Rainbow-Table) is a precomputed table, made of **11.110.097** entries, for reversing strings encrypted using the [MD5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5) hash function. The table is splitted into small chunks to easily navigate it, even with less powered computers. There are exactly 12 .csv files in the repository: the first 11 files have 1.000.000 entries each, while the 12th contains the remainings.

This table cames from a service of mine, previously hosted on my website [www.audero.it](http://www.audero.it), that I'm dismissing. Instead of deleting it, I thought it would be nice to open the data to the community to allow everyone to use them. I hope you'll enjoy.
